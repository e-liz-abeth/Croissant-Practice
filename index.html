        A <b>croissant</b> is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry
        inspired by the shape of the utrian Kipferl but using the French
        yeast=leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape, the dough is layer with butter, rolled and
        folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called laminating. It results in a delicious buttery pastry
        that can be enjoyed during anytime of the day.
